/data contains the h5 subset of data used to train the model, the data is in atomic units but converted to eV/A in the dataloader
/dipeptides contains the dataloader for the h5 file and "model", which is a shorthand for defining the CACE model used in this example
/models contains checkpoints of the trained models used to make the figures
figures.ipynb contains the code used to make the figures for the paper
fit-dipeptides.py contains the training script used to train the models
